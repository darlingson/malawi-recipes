Chambo is one of the most popular fish in Malawi, often enjoyed grilled or fried. Here’s a simple recipe to prepare a delicious **Chambo Fish**.

## Ingredients

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
    <li>2 medium-sized Chambo fish (or your preferred fish)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh coriander for garnish</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges (optional)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### 1. **Clean the Fish**
Start by cleaning and gutting the Chambo fish. Rinse under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.

### 2. **Marinate the Fish**
Rub the fish with a bit of salt, paprika, and ground cumin. Let it marinate for about 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors.

### 3. **Prepare the Sauce**
In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add the minced garlic and ginger to the pan and stir for another 2 minutes.

### 4. **Cook the Tomatoes**
Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook for another 5-7 minutes until they break down and create a thick sauce.

### 5. **Fry the Fish**
In a separate pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Fry the marinated Chambo fish on both sides for about 4-5 minutes per side or until golden brown and crispy.

### 6. **Serve**
Once the fish is cooked, place it on a serving platter. Pour the tomato sauce over the fish and garnish with fresh coriander and lemon wedges.

Enjoy your freshly prepared **Chambo Fish** with nsima or your favorite side dishes.
