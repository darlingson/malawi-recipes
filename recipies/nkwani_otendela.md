### Nkhwani Otendela (Pumpkin Leaves with Groundnuts - Nsinjilo)

#### Ingredients:
- Fresh pumpkin leaves (about 2 cups, chopped)
- 1 cup groundnut flour (finely ground peanuts)
- 1 onion (chopped)
- 1 tomato (chopped)
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- Salt (to taste)
- Water (as needed)

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the leaves**: Wash the pumpkin leaves thoroughly and chop them into small pieces.
2. **Sauté the onions**: Heat the cooking oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until soft and golden.
3. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they form a thick sauce.
4. **Cook the leaves**: Add the chopped pumpkin leaves and stir them into the tomato mixture.
5. **Simmer**: Pour in a little water (about 1/4 cup) and let the leaves cook on low heat for 5 minutes until softened.
6. **Add groundnut flour**: In a small bowl, mix the groundnut flour with a little water to make a smooth paste. Add this paste to the pot and stir well.
7. **Finish cooking**: Allow the mixture to simmer for another 5-10 minutes, adding salt to taste. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
8. **Serve**: Once the groundnut mixture has thickened and the leaves are tender, remove from heat. Serve with nshima or rice.
